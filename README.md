# SimpleCSharpCompiler
WinForms(MVP) based CSharp compiler to work with console


Hey! This is a simple version of CSharp Compiler written by me. In this projet to design interface i used the TELERIK UI for better design.
If you want to run this projet on your PC, you will need to [download](https://www.telerik.com/products/winforms.aspx) Telerik UI for WinForms in official website.
